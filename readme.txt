== Description ==

MBLA is an acronym for "MyBlogLog Avatars" and is a plugin for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org).

It can add [avatars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%28icon%29) from i.e. [MyBlogLog](http://mybloglog.com) and [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) to blog posts and comments.

You can easly switch between [MyBlogLog](http://mybloglog.com) and/or [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) [avatars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%28icon%29). The output is fully CSS and HTML customizable and the plugin comes with a built in cache control - everything is handled through MBLA's own option page.

Please take general questions, comments, enhancement requests, etc. to the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/mbla/wiki/FAQ) or list of [issues](http://code.google.com/p/mbla/issues/list) and I will try to deal with them as soon as possible.
